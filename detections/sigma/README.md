# Sigma Detection Rules – Discovery Techniques

This folder contains Sigma detection rules mapped to MITRE ATT&CK Discovery techniques
based on hands-on lab activity.

## Techniques Covered
- **T1018 – Remote System Discovery**
- **T1046 – Network Service Discovery**
- **T1049 – System Network Connections**

## Purpose
These rules demonstrate how attacker discovery behavior can be detected
using Windows Firewall logs and Sysmon network events.

## Notes
- Rules are written in experimental mode for lab environments.
- False positives may occur from legitimate admin or monitoring activity.
- Designed to support SIEM ingestion and threat hunting workflows.
