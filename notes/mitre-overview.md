# MITRE ATT&CK — Overview of the 14 Tactics

This file summarizes each MITRE ATT&CK tactic in simple terms.

---

## 1. Initial Access
How attackers get into a system for the first time (e.g., phishing, exploiting websites).

## 2. Execution
How attackers run malicious code (PowerShell, scripts, malware).

## 3. Persistence
Methods used to stay inside even after reboot (startup folders, scheduled tasks).

## 4. Privilege Escalation
Ways attackers gain admin or SYSTEM-level access.

## 5. Defense Evasion
Techniques used to avoid detection (clear logs, disable security tools).

## 6. Credential Access
Stealing passwords, hashes, tokens, or keystrokes.

## 7. Discovery
Exploring the environment (users, files, network scanning).

## 8. Lateral Movement
Moving from one computer to another (RDP, SMB, pass-the-hash).

## 9. Collection
Gathering the data they want to steal (screenshots, clipboard data).

## 10. Command and Control (C2)
Attacker communicates with infected systems.

## 11. Exfiltration
Sending stolen data outside the network.

## 12. Impact
Causing damage (ransomware, deleting data, stopping services).

## 13. Resource Development
Attackers preparing tools, malware, and infrastructure before attacking.

## 14. Reconnaissance
Researching the target (emails, systems, public info).
